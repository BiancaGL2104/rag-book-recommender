      "ANSWER:\n",
      " Based on the user's query for wholesome fantasy with found family vibes, I recommend the following two books:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **All-of-a-Kind Family Uptown** by Sydney Taylor — This classic children's book is a heartwarming tale of a Jewish immigrant family in New York City. The story follows the five sisters and their adventures as they grow up together, creating a sense of found family. The book exudes warmth, humor, and a strong sense of community.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **All Families Are Psychotic** by Douglas Coupland — Although not traditional fantasy, this novel explores the complexities of family dynamics in a humorous and relatable way. The story follows a dysfunctional family as they navigate their relationships with each other, and while it may not be a typical found-family tale, it does touch on themes of belonging and connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there are no obvious fantasy books that fit the query, I did not recommend any from the first book on the list. However, if you're interested in exploring more fantasy options, **Fantasy Gone Wrong** by various authors might offer some unexpected gems. Keep in mind that the tone and themes of these stories may vary depending on the author and style.\n",

    "We initially explored using the RAGAS library for evaluation, but the current version requires an OpenAI API key even for retrieval-focused metrics. Since our system runs fully locally (Ollama + FAISS) and we did not want to depend on external APIs, we instead implemented simple retrieval metrics inspired by RAGAS:\n",

    "For a set of 20 evaluation queries (e.g., “Cozy fantasy with romance and a strong female lead”, “Mystery novel with a female detective”), we inspected the retrieved titles and marked which ones were actually relevant. Using k=5, we obtained an average precision@5 of X and recall@5 of Y. This suggests that the retriever usually surfaces at least one relevant book in its top-5 results, but often mixes it with partially related or off-genre titles."

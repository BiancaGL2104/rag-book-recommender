      "• **The Woman in White** by Wilkie Collins — This classic novel features a strong female lead, Marian Halcombe, who plays a crucial role in uncovering the mystery surrounding Laura Fairlie's disappearance. The book is set in the 19th century and combines elements of gothic horror, mystery, and romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **The Women's War** by Alexandre Dumas (translated by Robin Buss) — Although not exclusively focused on a single strong female lead, this historical novel features a cast of powerful women who shape the events of the story. Set in 18th-century France, the book explores themes of love, war, and social change.\n",

However, if you're interested in exploring more options, **A Woman in Jerusalem** by A.B. Yehoshua (translated by Hillel Halkin) could be a good starting point.

    "In this notebook we extended the basic RAG pipeline with several generator-side features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mood-aware recommendations:**  \n",
    "  We detect a simple mood label (`happy`, `sad`, `neutral`) from the user query using a HuggingFace sentiment model plus a small keyword heuristic.  \n",
    "  The detected mood is injected into the system prompt so the LLM adapts its tone.  \n",
    "  For example, a happy query leads to fun, light fantasy romance suggestions, while a sad query triggers comforting, hopeful self-help style recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explain mode:**  \n",
    "  The `explain=True` flag changes the task instruction so the LLM explicitly justifies each recommendation (genres, themes, ratings, year) and may also mention why some retrieved books were not chosen.  \n",
    "  We showed side-by-side outputs for the same query with and without `explain=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Second opinion mode:**  \n",
    "  The `second_opinion=True` flag asks the LLM to provide an alternative perspective to a previous answer using the same retrieved books and chat history.  \n",
    "  In our tests, the second opinion mostly rephrased and slightly re-weighted the recommendations, which we discuss as a possible area for further tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Additionally, the second-opinion mode was enhanced with a higher temperature and explicit instructions encouraging variation, so the model provides an alternative perspective rather than repeating the previous recommendation verbatim.\n",
